                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p>
                    The C# race consists of intelligent beings of exceptional power. They were once humans who
                    underwent a transformative ritual that granted them immortality and demigod like powers in order to
                    safeguard their nation in its darkest hours. A great C# champion is capable of handling many aspects
                    of developing an application, including but not limited to performance, scalability, security,
                    testing, and more. C# developers can develop modern applications that run on desktop computers, or
                    even sophisticated back-end processes powering modern web applications.

                <p>
                    The Java race is a powerful group of people in the SoftUni empire. Java champions are beings of
                    great power and knowledge who are some of the most sought-after talents in the code wizarding
                    world.Their language is one of the most portable languages available which makes it possible for a
                    great Java champion to build a highly distributed web application, a sophisticated desktop
                    application, or even a powerful mobile application running on a handheld device.

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    Champions from the JavaScript race are gifted with a highly imaginative mind and great set of
                    skills. They combine the art of design with the art of programming by implementing the front-end
                    logic that defines the behavior of the visual elements of a web application and connecting it with
                    the services that reside on the back-end.

                <h2>PHP</h2>
                <p>PHP is a very ancient and powerful race which consists of prolific champions who write server-side
                    web application logic. Champions from this race usually develop back-end components, connect the
                    application with the other web services or develop and integrate plugins for certain popular
                    frameworks.
