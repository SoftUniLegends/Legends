                    In the codelands of Bulgaria, there was once a great city. It perished long ago in a terrible Code War, like most of the lands below the
                    Internet Barrier.
                    Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named Kenov. Being obsessed with code, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city's code school -
                    SoftUni.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kenov barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous code had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia.
                    This mystical disease granted his code immortality.  The most torturous aspect of this curse is that Kenov
                    sometimes experiences Sofia as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins.
                    Only the powerful summoning code employed by members of the
                    SoftUni has been able to treat this condition, and Kenov has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save his code.
