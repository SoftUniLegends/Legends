                    She grew up as the family's only daughter, and she immediately took to the advanced education and lavish parties required of families as high                         profile as the Code Fighters.
                    As Maria matured, it became clear that she was extraordinarily gifted. She could design tricks that made people believe they had seen things that                     did not actually exist.
                    She could also hide in plain sight. Somehow, she was able to reverse engineer arcane magical designs after seeing them made only once.
