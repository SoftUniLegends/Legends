                    One of the reasons CodeVill is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily high code rate.
                    This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder,
                    primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Gabriela discovered her natural gift for coding at age of 14.
                    At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gabriela quickly gained notoriety.
                    She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in CodeVill. Her services were soon requested by
                    SoftUni to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.
