                    Leader of a secret clan of mystic warriors, Yonkov serves as the Eye of CodeLight, entrusted to enforce balance in the world wide web.
                    Longing to remain free from the confusion of emotion, Yonkov continually struggles width a spirit keyboard in hand, to code the unseen path in the                    deepest dark web.

                    Within him exists an uneasy fusion of human soul and arcane power. He is seen by both sides as someone to be feared. He is immovable. He is                           constant.
                    He answers to nothing but his purpose. He is the chosen leader of a web order.
                    There are countless legends recounting Shenâ€™s battles across the realms.
                    Though Shen codes a lonely path on both this web and beyond, he does not always code alone.
                    Other members of his hidden secret SoftUni society always stand ready to assist him.
