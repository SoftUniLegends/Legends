                    Beauty and danger: There are few who can match Boryana in either.
                    One of SoftUni's most infamous code hunters, she built her legend code skills upon a swathe of high-tech computers.
                    The booming echoes of her twin keyboards in the port cityâ€™s reeking wharfs and scavenger shanties are sure
                    signs of another warrant from the Bounty Board being settled.

                    Young Boryana helped her mother in the forge, filing wheel locks, calibrating trigger pulls, or casting custom code shot.
                    Her skill in crafting frameworks was legendary, and her bespoke methods were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy noble.
