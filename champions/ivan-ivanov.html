                    Ivan is a man of resolve, a strong javaman who wields the code itself to cut down his foes.
                    This once-proud code has been disgraced by a infinite loop and forced into a desperate lonely code for survival.
                    With the web turned against him, he will do everything in his power to bring the guilty to justice and restore his honor.
                </p>

                    Formerly a brilliant pupil at a renowned SoftUni code school, Ivan was the only student in a generation to master the legendary code technique.
                    Many believed he was destined to become a great hero. However, his fate was changed forever when web Worms invided. Ivan was charged with guarding                    an Ionian Elder, but, foolishly believing his code alone could make the difference, he left his post to join the fray. By the time he returned,
                    the web Worm had taken all the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ivan raised his java code against the Worm and fought his way free.
