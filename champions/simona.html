                    There is a world far away populated by graceful and beautiful winged beings gifted with great coding skills,
                    where an ancient conflict still rages.
                    Like so many code conflicts, this war split worlds.
                    One side proclaimed themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world wide web under
                    their law and strong central governance.
                    Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view,
                    who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety.
                    Simona was one who code against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was branded ''fallen.''
                    This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general of the opposition's army.
