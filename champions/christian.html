                    Kristian, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of the Battlefields.
                    Kristian is the most renowned for remaining cool under code fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of coders madness.

                    Before SoftUni, he served several tours of duty to program, often volunteering for missions that would take him behind enemy lines,
                    either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a
                    good coffee in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Kristian also made several modifications to his computer, outfitting it with an arsenal
                    of short cuts which some speculate were more for show than functionality.
                    When Bankin joined SoftUni, it was no surprise to see Kristian follow soon after, eager to test his mettle
                    against the best coders the world has to offer.
