                    With each variable she fires from her high-tech ice-enchanted computer, Alisa proves she is a master coder.
                    She chooses each name carefully, waits for the right moment, and then strikes with power and precision.
                    It is with this same vision and focus that she pursues her goal of unit testing all her code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a child, Alisa was always a dreamer. She marveled at the colossal, abandoned fortresses of her ancestors,
                    and spent hours by the fire listening to tales about brave Web devs. She swore one day she would join the scattered and warlike
                    tribes of the SoftUni. She knew in her heart that if her people would stand
                    together once more, they would reach greatness again.
