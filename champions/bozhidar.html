                    Bojidar walked the gold-paved Emperor’s Web.
                    The soft, shadowy light of the new visual studio seeped through his website. The brightest stars still shone overhead, though they would soon be                      snuffed out by the rising sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dark web was not as Bojidar remembered it; the stars and the constellations were misaligned.
                    When last he had coded this path, an honor guard of 100 elite programmers had marched in his wake, and the cheers of the crowd had shaken the city.
                    It was to have been his moment of glory – yet it had been stolen from him.
                    Now, it was a website of ghosts. What had become of his people?
                    With an imperious gesture, Bojidar commanded his people beside the roadway to rise, creating living statues, populating the website.
