                    It is seldom the case where a champion is defined by his actions after joining SoftUni rather than before.
                    Such is the case with Bankin, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the  Institute of                      Code War.

                    Before joining SoftUni, Bankin was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire.
                    For reasons known only to the League Master, Bankin was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview                         process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.
                    His Judgment was the quickest in SoftUni history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began.
                    Bankin proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Code Justice.
