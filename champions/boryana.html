                    Beauty and danger: There are few who can match Miss Fortune in either.
                    One of SoftUni's most infamous code hunters, she built her legend code skills upon a swathe of high-tech computers.
                    The booming echoes of her twin keyboards in the port city’s reeking wharfs and scavenger shanties are sure signs of another warrant from the                          Bounty Board being settled.

                    Young Boryana helped her mother in the forge, filing wheel locks, calibrating trigger pulls, or casting custom pistol shot.
                    Her mother’s skill in crafting firearms was legendary, and her bespoke handguns were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy noble.
                    But ofttimes, they were desired by those with more meager means and darker hearts.
                    One who desired such a weapon was an up-and-coming reaver of Bilgewater called Gangplank.
                    Cocksure and certain of his power, he demanded Sarah’s mother fashion a pair of pistols the likes of which no other man possessed.
                    A reluctant deal was struck, and a year later to the day, Gangplank returned for his weapons. He had donned a red scarf face-mask and had no
                    intention of paying for the guns – he was there to take them by force.
