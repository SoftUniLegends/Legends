                 Twisted Fate is an infamous card sharp and swindler who has gambled and charmed his way across much of the known world,
                 earning the enmity and admiration of the rich and foolish alike. He rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an                      insouciant swagger.In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Born to the nomadic river-folk of the Serpentine, the boy was taught the magic of the cards at an early age and soon learned what it was to be hated.
                 Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange ways, the boy's people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their
                 colorful river barques. His elders claimed this was the way of the world, but their refusal to fight back against this prejudice always rankled the                   young boy's sensibilities.
             </p>
             <p>
                 When men who'd lost their fortunes in the gambling tents of the river folk returned in the dead of night to exact vengeance,
                 they came bearing cudgels and emboldened by cheap rotgut. They beat the river folk back to their boats with curses and blows,
                 eventually turning their weapons upon the boy's family. The boy could take no more and fought back, driving the men away with swift blows from their                  own clubs.
             </p>
             <p>
                 Proud of what he had done, the boy was stunned when his people turned their back on him. Retaliation went against the code of the river,
                 and there could be only one punishment. Exile. His whole world falling apart around him, the boy watched helplessly as the barques of his
                 folk sailed away without him, leaving him with nothing, alone for the first time in his life.
