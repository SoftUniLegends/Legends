2.Nikolay Bankin
  Role: Trainer
  Race:
  Champion: Jax
  Description: Grandmaster at Arms
  Line: "Let's code this!"
  Info:
    It is seldom the case where a champion is defined by his actions after joining SoftUni rather than before.
    Such is the case with Bankin, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the  Institute of Code War.
    Before joining SoftUni, Bankin was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire.
    For reasons known only to the League Master, Bankin was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that
    either accepts or rejects a prospective champion.
    His Judgment was the quickest in SoftUni history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began.
    Bankin proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Code Justice.

  Line: Code from above!
  Info:

     Kristian, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of the Battlefields.
    Kristian is the most renowned for remaining cool under code fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of coders madness.
    Before SoftUni, he served several tours of duty to program, often volunteering for missions that would take him behind enemy lines,
    either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones. He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a
    good coffee in the morning. More than just an ace pilot, Kristian also made several modifications to his computer, outfitting it with an arsenal
    of short cuts which some speculate were more for show than functionality.
    When Bankin joined SoftUni, it was no surprise to see Kristian follow soon after, eager to test his mettle
    against the best coders the world has to offer.

  The soft, shadowy light of the new visual studio seeped through his website. The brightest stars still shone overhead, though they would soon be snuffed out by the rising sun.
  The dark web was not as Bojidar remembered it; the stars and the constellations were misaligned.
  When last he had coded this path, an honor guard of 100 elite programmers had marched in his wake, and the cheers of the crowd had shaken the city.
  It was to have been his moment of glory – yet it had been stolen from him.
  Now, it was a website of ghosts. What had become of his people?
  With an imperious gesture, Bojidar commanded his people beside the roadway to rise, creating living statues, populating the website.

  but, foolishly believing his code alone could make the difference, he left his post to join the fray. By the time he returned,

   Description: the Machine Herald
   Line:  "Live and die by my Code."

   Info:
   Svetlin's earliest memories are the darkness of underground computer clubs.
   He remembers no family, warmth, or kindness. Kept alive only by his quick keyboard writing, Svetlin scraped out a living
   in the seedy underbelly of Sofia. His mastery of the binary code quickly marked him as a threat, and SoftUni guilds sent assassins
   to him with a demand: join their ranks or be killed.
   Svetlin chose life, on the condition that his service was to good code practices alone.







11.Ivaylo Kenov
   Role: Trainer
   Race: JavaScript
   Champion: Zilean
   Description: the Chronokeeper
   Line: "I knew you would code that... "
   Info:
   In the codelands of Bulgaria, there was once a great city. It perished long ago in a terrible Code War, like most of the lands below the
   Internet Barrier.
   Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named Kenov. Being obsessed with code, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city's code school -
   SoftUni.

Kenov barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous code had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia.
This mystical disease granted his code immortality.  The most torturous aspect of this curse is that Kenov
sometimes experiences Sofia as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins.
Only the powerful summoning code employed by members of the
SoftUni has been able to treat this condition, and Kenov has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save his code.

   Angel once said 'It's not gambling if you can't lose...''
Angel is an infamous card sharp and swindler who has gambled and charmed his way across much of the known world,
earning the enmity and admiration of the rich and foolish alike. He rarely takes things seriously,
greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger.
In every possible way, Angel always has an ace up his sleeve.
Born to the nomadic river-folk of the Serpentine, the boy was taught the magic of the cards at an early age.
His elders claimed this was the way of the world, but their refusal to fight back against this prejudice always rankled
the young boy's code.


13.Alisa Terzieva
   Role: Trainer
   Race: JavaScript
   Champion: Ashe
   Description: the Frost Archer
   Line: "All the code on one arrow."
   Info:
   With each variable she fires from her high-tech ice-enchanted computer, Alisa proves she is a master coder.
   She chooses each name carefully, waits for the right moment, and then strikes with power and precision.
   It is with this same vision and focus that she pursues her goal of unit testing all her code.

   As a child, Alisa was always a dreamer. She marveled at the colossal, abandoned fortresses of her ancestors,
   and spent hours by the fire listening to tales about brave Web devs. She swore one day she would join the scattered and warlike
   tribes of the SoftUni. She knew in her heart that if her people would stand
   together once more, they would reach greatness again.

   Description: Fallen Angel
   Line: "We'll bring them pain."
   Info:
    There is a world far away populated by graceful and beautiful winged beings gifted with great coding skills,
    where an ancient conflict still rages.
    Like so many code conflicts, this war split worlds.
    One side proclaimed themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world wide web under
    their law and strong central governance.
    Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view,
    who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety.
    Simona was one who code against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was branded ''fallen.''
    This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general of the opposition's army.



Students:

15.Gabriela Ivanova
   Role: Student
   Race: PHP
   Champion: Caitlyn
   Description: the Sheriff of CodeVill
   Line: "I'm on the case."
   Info:
   ''Go ahead, run. I'll give you a five minute head start.''
   One of the reasons CodeVill is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily high code rate.
   This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder,
   primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research.
   Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Gabriela discovered her natural gift for coding at age of 14.
    At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible.

   Gabriela quickly gained notoriety.
   She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in CodeVill. Her services were soon requested by
   SoftUni to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists.

    Line: "Fortune doesn't favor fools."
    Info:
    Beauty and danger: There are few who can match Boryana in either.
    One of SoftUni's most infamous code hunters, she built her legend code skills upon a swathe of high-tech computers.
    The booming echoes of her twin keyboards in the port city’s reeking wharfs and scavenger shanties are sure
    signs of another warrant from the Bounty Board being settled.

    Young Boryana helped her mother in the forge, filing wheel locks, calibrating trigger pulls, or casting custom code shot.
    Her skill in crafting frameworks was legendary, and her bespoke methods were to be found in the collections of many a wealthy noble.
